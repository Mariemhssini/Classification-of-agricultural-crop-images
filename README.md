# Project 1: Agricultural Crop Image Classification

## Project Description

In this project, the goal is to develop an image classification model to distinguish between five types of agricultural crops: wheat, rice, sugarcane, corn, and jute. The dataset consists of over 40 images for each crop, with an augmented set containing over 159 images per class through operations such as horizontal flipping, rotation, and horizontal and vertical shifting.

## Tasks

1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, examine sample images, and review associated labels.
  
2. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess, resize, and normalize images to make them suitable for training a classification model. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
  
3. **Model Creation:** Design and train an image classification model. Start with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and experiment with different architectures. Consider using transfer learning from pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception. The use of ensemble methods is also recommended.
  
4. **Data Augmentation:** Explore the effect of augmentations on the model's performance. Apply additional data augmentation if necessary.
  
5. **Model Training:** Train the model on the training data while monitoring performance metrics such as loss and accuracy.
  
6. **Validation and Optimization:** Validate the model on the validation dataset, adjust hyperparameters if needed, and monitor for overfitting.
  
7. **Final Evaluation:** Evaluate the model on the test dataset to measure its final performance. Use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
  
8. **Deployment as a Web Application:** Explore the possibility of deploying the model as a web application.

## Web Application (Work in Progress)

I am currently working on developing a web application that will utilize this agricultural crop image classification model. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for real-time classification of agricultural crop images.
